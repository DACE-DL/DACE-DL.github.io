<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
As the number of RDF datasets published on the semantic web continues to grow,
		it becomes increasingly important to efficiently link similar entities between these datasets. However,
		the performance of existing data linking tools, often developed for general purposes, seems to have reached a plateau,
		suggesting the need for more modular and efficient solutions. We propose-and formalize in OWL-a classification of the different Linking Problem Types (LPTs) to help
		the linked data community identify upstream the problems and develop more efficient solutions.
		By classifying LPTs, we provide a framework for understanding and addressing the challenges associated with semantic data linking.
		It can be used to develop new solutions based on existing modularized tools addressing specific LPTs, thus improving the overall efficiency of data linking.</span>
